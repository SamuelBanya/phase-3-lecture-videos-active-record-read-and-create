Here are the commands that were run for this particular lesson:
#+begin_src ruby
a1 = Author.new()
a1[:name] = "Bubbles"
a1[:bio] = "is a shy cat"
a1.save()
#+end_src

She then checked her results with these commands:
#+begin_src ruby
Author.all()
Author.last()
#+end_src

She then used this command to create a new instance which will create a new instance AND save it to the database, aka '.create()':
#+begin_src ruby
Author.create(name:"Luke", bio:"is fluffy")

Author.last()
#+end_src

She then created another instance with this command:
#+begin_src ruby
Author.create(name:"Bob", bio:"is a grump")
#+end_src
